											<h1>How can a <u style="color:#006400">dollar</u>
											generate <u style="color:#006400">data?</u></h1>
											<p>Addressing food equity on Vashon Island with a unique, data-driven approach.
											</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											We reimagined how a <strong> dollar </strong> can generate <strong> data</strong>. <br> <br>
											<a href="https://hen-indigo-4ec2.squarespace.com/">Food Access Partnership</a> on Vashon Island 
											distributes cash to the community to minimize costs of locally grown food, but the paper
											currency they create and distribute suffers from low redemption rates. Improving this 
											system, our solution provides real time data for partnering nonprofits and farmers 
											while preserving the familiar paper “Farm Buck.” Now, our stakeholders can track 
											Farm Bucks through the system and encourage users to redeem them at farmer’s markets
											and farm stands. Placing data in the hands of organizers, we’re helping Vashon 
											Islanders address food equity in their community.
